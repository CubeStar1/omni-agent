# HackRx Execution Directory

This directory is used for executing JavaScript code generated by the AI agent during HackRx challenges.

## Purpose
- Contains dynamically generated JavaScript files
- Files are executed using Node.js to solve computational problems
- Results are captured and used to answer challenge questions

## File Naming
- Files are named with timestamp and random suffix: `hackrx_[timestamp]_[random].js`
- Custom filenames can be specified when calling the execution tool

## Security
- Files are executed in a controlled environment
- 30-second timeout prevents infinite loops
- Only JavaScript execution is allowed using Node.js

## Cleanup
- Files are persistent for debugging purposes
- Can be manually cleaned up as needed
- .gitignore prevents committing generated files to version control
